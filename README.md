# Why Claude for Desktop and not Claude.ai?
Because servers are locally run, MCP currently only supports desktop hosts. Remote hosts are in active development.

# Use cases and benefits sonarqube
- Retrieve SonarQube metrics and issues programmatically
- Integrate SonarQube data into AI assistants or automation workflows
- Enable AI models to query and analyze code quality data dynamically
- Build custom dashboards or reporting tools leveraging MCP abstraction


# SonarQube Jenkins MCP Server
1. **MCP Servers:** Deploy MCP servers for both Jenkins and SonarQube.
2. **Jenkins Pipeline:** Create a Jenkins pipeline that includes stages for:
- Code checkout
- SonarQube analysis (using SonarScanner)
- Interaction with Jenkins MCP server
- Interaction with SonarQube MCP server
3. **Python Scripts:** Use Python scripts within the Jenkins pipeline to call MCP tools exposed by the Jenkins and SonarQube MCP servers.
4. **SonarQube Setup:** Configure SonarQube with necessary tokens and quality gates.


# Use cases for MCP server integration with Jenkins and SonarQube
1.  Automated Code Quality Enforcement in CI Pipelines
- Use the MCP server to programmatically trigger SonarQube scans from Jenkins jobs and retrieve quality gate results.
- Automatically fail or continue Jenkins pipelines based on SonarQube quality gate status, enforcing code quality standards without manual intervention.
- Example: After a Jenkins build completes, an MCP client calls the SonarQube MCP server to fetch the quality gate status; if the gate fails, the Jenkins job is aborted or flagged as failed
```Bash
from mcp.client import Client

sonarqube_client = Client("http://sonarqube-mcp-server:8000")

quality_gate = sonarqube_client.call_tool(
    "get_quality_gate_status",
    params={"projectKey": "my-project-key"}
)

print("Quality Gate Status:", quality_gate)

if quality_gate.get("status") != "OK":
    raise Exception("Quality gate failed - aborting pipeline")
```
2.  Unified Dashboard for Build and Code Quality Metrics
- Aggregate Jenkins job statuses and SonarQube code quality metrics through MCP servers into a single AI assistant or dashboard.
- Enable developers and managers to query build results, test coverage, code smells, and technical debt in one place using natural language or scripted queries.
- Example: An AI assistant connected via MCP can answer questions like “Show me the latest Jenkins build status and SonarQube quality report for project X”
3.  Automated Issue Detection and Remediation Suggestions
- Use MCP servers to extract SonarQube issues and code smells and feed them into AI models that suggest fixes or refactoring steps.
- Integrate with Jenkins to automatically create tickets or trigger remediation jobs when critical issues are detected.
- Example: After a SonarQube scan, the MCP server provides issue details to an AI assistant, which generates code improvement suggestions or creates Jenkins jobs to apply fixes.
4.  Dynamic Jenkins Job Management Based on SonarQube Insights
- Use MCP to monitor SonarQube metrics and dynamically adjust Jenkins job parameters or trigger additional tests for risky code changes.
- Example: If SonarQube reports increased code complexity or new security vulnerabilities, MCP-driven automation can trigger extended Jenkins test suites or security scans.
```Bash
from mcp.client import Client

sonarqube_client = Client("http://sonarqube-mcp-server:8000")

quality_gate = sonarqube_client.call_tool(
    "get_quality_gate_status",
    params={"projectKey": "my-project-key"}
)

print("Quality Gate Status:", quality_gate)

if quality_gate.get("status") != "OK":
    raise Exception("Quality gate failed - aborting pipeline")
``` 
5.  Seamless Multi-Tool Integration in Pipelines
- Leverage MCP to abstract Jenkins and SonarQube APIs, allowing pipeline scripts to interact with both tools uniformly via MCP clients.
- Simplify pipeline code by offloading API integration complexities to MCP servers, making pipelines more maintainable and extensible.
- Example: A Jenkins pipeline calls MCP tools to start builds, run SonarQube analysis, fetch results, and decide next steps based on combined data.
6.  Real-Time Notifications and Feedback Loops
- Configure MCP servers to relay Jenkins build and SonarQube analysis results to chatops tools or notification systems.
- Provide developers with immediate feedback on build success, code quality regressions, or quality gate failures.
- Example: Upon build completion, MCP servers send summarized results to Slack or Microsoft Teams, enabling rapid response to issues.

# Note
1. 
```Bash
from typing import Any
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("weather")

# Constants
NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov"
USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0"
```

---> The FastMCP class uses Python type hints and docstrings to automatically generate tool definitions, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools:
- Send and receive data from MCP server
- Manage version and authenticate
- Fix error and response from host
